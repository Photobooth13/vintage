        <h3 class="model-11">Vintage Photo Booth Model 11.</h3>
        <p>Vintage photo booth model 11 is dating back to 1960's. Other companies can certainly sell you a photo booth, but there is no other company who will completely rework and refurbish the machine for you from the ground up. There are very few
          companies who even know how to work with these machines anymore and while you can probably obtain a photo booth for less money, it will just be a used machine. By used, I mean it will be a 30+ year old machine with original parts. Photo
          booths are delicate and cannot withstand all that time without being reworked. The classic photo booths also allows for a text logo and background to be included to personalize the experience!.</p>
